# GlacierAndPhoenix
* A primary CG program served as a CG class project in SJTU.
* Developed by OpenGL (Core-profile).
* Implement a scene including weather, time, fires, glacier and a (impressionistic) phenix.
* Particle genators make up most of the project.
* You will not run this project on your own computer successfully without some libraries that need to be carefully prepared and placed for the building and linking. Take a reference to the Report to know more.
* The result can be seen clearly through the [video](https://github.com/zrdumped/GlacierAndPhoenix/releases/download/v1.0/CG.demo.mp4)
