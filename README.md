# GlacierAndPhenix
* A primary CG program served as a CG class project in SJTU.
* Implement a scene including weather, time, fires, glacier and a (impressionistic) phenix.
* Particle genators make up most of the project.
* You will not run this project on your own computer successfully without some libraries that need to be carefully prepared and placed for the building and linking. Take a reference to the Report to know more.
* If you want to know briefly about the result, you can watch the Video, which is not so clear but compact.
* This project just serve as a backup for myself now.
